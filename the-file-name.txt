A creature stuck in place can break loose by using a standard action to make a DC 15 Strength check or Escape Artist check. Each round at the beginning of your turn, any creature within the area must succeed on another Reflex save to avoid becoming stuck in place again. The effect of this spell even extends through footwear, so merely removing your boots doesn\u0027t free you from the effect. Creatures not in contact with the surface of the ground (such as flying, burrowing or incorporeal creatures) are unaffected by sticky floor.
